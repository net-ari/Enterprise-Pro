# Project description (for reference)
Rakusens is a traditional food manufacturer based in Leeds that is actively aiming towards modernising its processes via leveraging AI/Big Data technology. A key part of this includes an interactive, real-time visualisation dashboard for monitoring/viewing temperature data from a number of installed sensors. By using such a dashboard, operators will be more proficient in adjusting production temperatures in order to produce better quality products and increase energy efficiency, all in a manner driven by data insights. This project offers a lot of modular development potential, some of the tasks that could be tackled include the following: 

- create an API for automatically retrieving and parsing SQL database records a 'responsive' web design, in order for the tool to be used ubiquitously on desktop as well as tablets/mobile devices in a native manner

- add an authentication system allowing basic login functionality with abilities to reset passwords

- provide interactive visualisations and statistics for data aggregated by sensor, by using open-source libraries such as Plotly.js

- flag data points according to a 'traffic-light system' such that data points falling outside of the general observed trend are indicated/colored accordingly. For this task, a pre-developed Machine Learning model can be provided to the team in order to perform the flagging. allow visualisations to be updated in real-time.

# Requirements
1. User accesses the app on any system (mobile, desktop, any OS)
2. Users can log in or register with the ability to reset their password.
3. The system must retrieve the user’s data through a custom-made API.
4. The system must provide interactive visualisations and statistics for data aggregated by sensors.
5. The system must flag anomalies in the data points using a pretrained ML.
6. The system must be dynamic and updating regularly as close as to in real time as possible.

# Questions
1. What type of data will the model give us?
2. What scale is the program expected to handle?
3. What pages should the system have?
4. How do you want us to visualise the data?
5. Is there a specific design you want for the interface?
6. Who will be using the system?
7. Will there be users with different privileges and if so, what are they?
8. How are we expected to interact with the sensors?
9. How should the system behave if real-time data becomes temporarily unavailable?
10. What does real time mean in practice?
