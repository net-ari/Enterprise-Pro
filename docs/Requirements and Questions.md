# Requirements
1. User accesses the app on any system (mobile, desktop, any OS)
2. Users can log in or register with the ability to reset their password.
3. The system must retrieve the user’s data through a custom-made API.
4. The system must provide interactive visualisations and statistics for data aggregated by sensors.
5. The system must flag anomalies in the data points using a pretrained ML.
6. The system must be dynamic and updating regularly as close as to in real time as possible.

# Questions
1. What type of data will the model give us?
2. What scale is the program expected to handle?
3. What pages should the system have?
4. How do you want us to visualise the data?
5. Is there a specific design you want for the interface?
6. Who will be using the system?
7. Will there be users with different privileges and if so, what are they?
8. How are we expected to interact with the sensors?
9. How should the system behave if real-time data becomes temporarily unavailable?
10. What does real time mean in practice?
