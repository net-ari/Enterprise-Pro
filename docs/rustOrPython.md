# Rust

## Pros

- Faster than Python
- Type safety (less likely to screw up handling data?)
- Would make for a really efficient backend and 'show off' our skills

## Cons

- Need to learn it (...most of us)
- Time constraints (fixed deadline, not a lot of time to learn)
- How to port?

# Python

## Pros
- Everyone knows it (how could you not?)
- More easily portable
- Probably easier to write in for a majority of the group :/
- More efficient given the time constraints...
- Type hinting etc can be explained to the group
- Speed is negligible given the circumstances, shouldn't necessarily be massive amounts of incoming data

## Cons
- Not as fast as Rust could be.
- Lack of type safety (type hinting can kind of compensate for it)

# Conclusion
<p>Don't really think Rust is necessary here. Don't get me wrong it would be great...if we could actually leverage it as a group. But Python is probably gonna be easier if we don't want to be bashing our heads against a wall with an unfamiliar language. Plus, if we decide to go that route, Python can handle visualisation etc more gracefully, a lot of GUI libraries for Rust apparently aren't mature or still lack features.</p>
