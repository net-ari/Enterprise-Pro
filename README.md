# Enterprise-Pro
## Project description
Rakusens is a traditional food manufacturer based in Leeds that is actively aiming towards modernising its processes via leveraging AI/Big Data technology. A key part of this includes an interactive, real-time visualisation dashboard for monitoring/viewing temperature data from a number of installed sensors. By using such a dashboard, operators will be more proficient in adjusting production temperatures in order to produce better quality products and increase energy efficiency, all in a manner driven by data insights. This project offers a lot of modular development potential, some of the tasks that could be tackled include the following:
- create an API for automatically retrieving and parsing SQL database records a 'responsive' web design, in order for the tool to be used ubiquitously on desktop as well as tablets/mobile devices in a native manner.
- add an authentication system allowing basic login functionality with abilities to reset passwords.
- provide interactive visualisations and statistics for data aggregated by sensor, by using open-source libraries such as Plotly.js.
- flag data points according to a 'traffic-light system' such that data points falling outside of the general observed trend are indicated/colored accordingly. For this task, a pre-developed Machine Learning model can be provided to the team in order to perform the flagging.
- allow visualisations to be updated in real-time.
